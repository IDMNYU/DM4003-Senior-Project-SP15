## END OF SEMESTER DELIVERABLES

### PROCESS PDF / SUPPORTING FILES 
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own dropbox link. 

Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual dropbox folder.
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:
* PDF of the book
* all related project documentation (e.g. video, HTML files, audio files, etc ) for
  * alpha
  * beta
  * gold


### PROCESS BOOK
Printed and bound copy of the book. I highly recommend http://blurb.com, but you have to allow time to get it printed and shipped. Printing and shipping averages around a week and a day.

Use the content of your project plan and blog for your process PDF & book. Here are two examples of some very good, production / process books:
* http://www.clickcolleen.com/foodforthought/CMiller_processbook.pdf
* http://issuu.com/russmaschmeyer/docs/motiv-process-book


### PROJECT WEBSITE
*NOTE: This is different than your Senior Project Blog.*
This website should market and promote your project. At the very least, it should contain a description, visual documentation, etc. Ideally, your project should have its own URL, but this is not required. A sub-domain is the next viable option.


### END OF SEMESTER PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS
Use the project plan guidelines as a guide for content. Your public presentation should showcase your completed senior project–gold version.

### END OF SEMESTER ASSESSMENT
* Please name your file as yourname_midterm_assessment.pdf
* Email your final self assessment *as a pdf* to deangela.duff@nyu.edu. Do NOT put self assessments on basecamp, a public forum.
* Critically analyze/evaluate your senior project process and progress
* What qualitative description would you give your overall process and why? (i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in this syllabus.)
* What qualitative description would you give the final execution of your project so far and why?
* Do your deliverables match your initial concept (or last impact statement)?
  * Did you do what you said you were going to do (integrity, accountability)?
* Did you execute all aspects of your project by the best means possible?

### SENIOR PROJECT FEEDBACK
* *Please name your file as yourname_senior_project_feedback.pdf*
* Feedback on the syllabus 
* Feedback on the course content (required books, screenings, etc.)
* Feedback on the course structure (weekly, individual meetings and group critiques, etc.)

Any printed assignments should always contain the following: 

* Date
* Your first and last name
* DM 4003 Senior Project in Digital Media
