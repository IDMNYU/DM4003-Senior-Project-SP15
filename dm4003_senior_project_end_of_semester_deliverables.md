## END OF SEMESTER DELIVERABLES

### DELIVERABLES FOR SENIOR PROJECT CATALOG / SUPPORTING FILES 
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own dropbox link. 

Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual dropbox folder.
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:
* **deliverables for the senior project catalog**
  * Title of your project
  * URL to your project website
  * *at least* 3, Hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
  * Abstract
* **all related project files** (e.g. video, HTML files, audio files, etc ) for
  * alpha
  * beta
  * gold

Here are two examples of some very good, project websites:

### PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
*NOTE: This is different than your <a href="dm4003_senior_project_blog.md">Senior Project Blog</a>.*
This website should market and promote your body of work for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. This should NOT be hosted on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu. Ideall, you should have your own domain name.


### END OF SEMESTER PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS
Use the project plan guidelines as a guide for content. Your public presentation should showcase your completed senior project–gold version.

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 minutes of Q&A 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total.
