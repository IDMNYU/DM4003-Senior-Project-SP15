## PROJECT BLOG

You should have a **dedicated** blog for Senior Project in Digital Media in wordpress on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu
* You can receive web server space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883. Email eltonkwok@nyu.edu to set up your web server space
* IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode to connect)

Spencer Hargiss’ process blog is a good example, http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/. Please use Spencer’s blog as a guide. Why?  
* You can clearly read what his project was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation (images and screenshots). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

**What your blog should contain?**
* at least, 1 post per week. The majority of the posts should be your own writing (well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar), but may also include images, illustrations, audio, video, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your project. 

* *Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration* 
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your project. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.)

**What your blog should NOT contain?**
* How you are feeling about your process or project? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your blog. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer and/or entrepreneur. You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.
* Any content that is NOT related to your project explicitly.
