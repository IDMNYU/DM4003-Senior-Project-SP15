## BRAINSTORMING TECHNIQUE: CARD SORTING

*Co-opted from Dana Karwas' Pre-Thesis Syllabus*

Card sorting is about creating associations between information. Please complete the following steps and take pictures of your cards at the end of each step. Post the results to your project website.

**CARD SORTING:**
* Use a dark pen or sharpie to write
* Get four different colors of post-it notes or index cards
* Take pictures of each step along the way. Make sure the photos are lit well and have good contrast.

**Step 1: PROJECT CARDS**

Identify fifteen existing digital media projects/apps/events/games/installations/etc. that are of interest to you and which relate to the thesis topics that you have been throwing around. Create project cards with the project names. For example if were inspired by the Rain Room installation at the MoMA you would write “Rain Room” on a project card. All the project cards should be the same color.

**Step 2: DESCRIPTOR CARDS**

Choose a second color of card and create a set of descriptor cards for each project by listing adjectives or traits of those projects. Try to extract at least five descriptor cards per project. For the Rain Room project the descriptor cards could be: environment, feeling of rain, spectacle, scientific, weather, biological connection, and installation.

**Step 3: ENABLER CARDS**

Choose a third color of card and create three enabler cards for each project. The enabler cards are underlying traits that enable the project to exist -- the technology, software, circumstance, environment, or tools that are needed for the project. For a painting, enabler cards would be paint, brushes, easel, subject, canvas, or light. (It is OK to use more than the suggested amount of cards.)

**Step 4 IDEA CARDS**

Now is the fun part. Take a look at all of your cards. Lay all the projects and their cards out on the table and start to pull descriptor and enabler cards that interest you (choosing from all the projects). Start to make associations between the cards to form ideas. If you don’t see what you.
