<td>Research / Reference / Inspiration</td>        
    <td>Including, but not limited to, brainstorming (thought maps, word lists, etc.), readings, screenings / viewings, investigation of other artists, designers, or entrepreneur’s work, comparative analysis of similar projects, tech research, material research, visual research, collection, interviews, observation, etc.

<tr>
<td>Development</td> 
<td>Prototype(s) – including, but not limited to, exercises, tests, models, maquettes, animatics 
* You should know what the concept of a prototype is, particularly if you took the RSMP course, but, if you do not know, a prototype “is an early sample or model built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.”
* As a result, a prototype can take on many forms. Essentially, it is your project or aspects of your project in an unfinished form.
* You should decide what kinds of prototype(s) are most appropriate for your project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Project Versions</td> 
    <td>* Alpha
    * Beta
    * Gold Version<br>
    Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle.
* Alpha Version is the testing phase of form and functionality
* Beta Version is when the functionality, form, and implementation is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.
* Gold Version is when all the bugs have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.
The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor. </td>
