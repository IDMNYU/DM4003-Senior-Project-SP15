    <li>You should know what the concept of a prototype is, particularly if you took the RSMP course, but, if you do not know, a prototype “is an early sample or model built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.”</li>
    <li>As a result, a prototype can take on many forms. Essentially, it is your project or aspects of your project in an unfinished form.</li>
