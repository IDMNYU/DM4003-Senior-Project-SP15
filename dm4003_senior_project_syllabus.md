## Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!

Senior Project is the capstone course for the Integrated Digital Media program. Senior Project mirrors the creative process that professional artists, designers, and entrepreneurs must practice throughout their entire careers. 

The primary goal for the student is to develop a hunger and passion for self-directed, life-long learning and creativity.  

To achieve this students will involve themselves in an semester-long thesis that includes a robust investigation of all phases of the creative process, including research, design, development, and user testing for the production of a substantial and mature body of work, representing their creative and conceptual skills as artists, designers, and/or entrepreneurs.

As you engage in the rigorous practice of a professional artist, designer, or entrepreneur, your project will naturally evolve and change, and may in fact take quite a different shape than what you present during Junior Review. This is normal and OK.


## Your Commitment to Senior Project
Excerpt from the book *Anything You Want* by Derek Sivers

     No “yes.” 
     Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”
     If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”—then say “no.” 

How are you currently feeling about your Senior Project? 
* Yes. 
* Hell Yeah! or 
* No:( 

If you are NOT feeling “Hell Yeah!” about your project, remember your project idea is just that YOURS. I highly suggest you read What is Senior Project, again, AND the required and recommended readings NOW!

Senior Project is about the work YOU are and will continue to do, when you are no longer a student. You don’t need anyone to whip you to work because you can NOT, not do it. You live, eat, breath, sleep this project. It is NOT about doing a project for a class or pleasing the Integrated Digital Media faculty. It is about you, your ideas, your concerns, your questions and your passion.

Senior Project is about demonstrating the maturity, responsibility, and integrity to manage your practice/research/investigation, while having the luxury of constructive critique and feedback from your fellow studio mates and advisors. Ultimately, your goal is to COMPLETE a project that has a life beyond school, beyond graduation.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. At a graduate level, students will:

* 1 – develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* 2 – develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* 3 – develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* 4 – gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will help students to:
* To determine, communicate, and accomplish your own vision and goals for your senior project. 
* To practice an iterative design process in conjunction with effective project management skills.
* To continue to hone all aspects of communication about your creative process and work through discourse, presentations, and writing.


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a body of work that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, funding, starting a business, etc.).


### COURSE STRUCTURE

This class will consist of 
* **Individual Meetings**<br>The weekly, individual 15 minute schedule will be determined on the first day of class.
* **Group critiques**<br>Group critiques will be held for two seniors every Wednesday, and will consist of the professor, ALL seniors, and outside critics, at times. 

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 to 15 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 to 15 minutes of critique 
     for 30 minutes total. 

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to at least one of their group critiques. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM or another department, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. 

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS

* Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person directly after class or set up an appointment about issues and problems. DO NOT email long conversations. (If your email turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not emailing me.)


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to the weekly group critique on Wednesdays and your individual meetings on time. 
* Participate in group critiques and discussions. Be vocal.
* Present your work during group critiques at least twice during the course of the semester. 
* Meet, individually, with the professor on a weekly basis during your scheduled time to discuss your project progress.
* Consult basecamp at least once a week for up to date info
* Maintain a weekly, senior studio project blog 
* Complete all deliverables by their due dates
* Acquire and read copies of the required books
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have self-motivation, proactiveness, and focus 
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during group critiques and every student’s end of semester presentations.  
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

You will be judged on the quality, relevance, iteration, completion, and presentation of your senior project’s alpha, beta, and gold version(s). 

###### A. Excellent (90-100)
The performance and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. The work clearly differentiates itself from other work. The work has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond original goals. The ideas behind the work are original, thoughtful and/or imaginative. Spelling, punctuation or grammatical errors are non-existent. The work demonstrates the student’s ability to think critically and work independently. The work also demonstrates the student’s use of strong methods and process.

###### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
The performance and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. The work is better than average and shows extra effort. The impact of the work is good, and demonstrates the utilization of the iterative process. The work employs above average craft and attention to detail.

###### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
The performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Average and competent, the work has acceptable levels of impact and conceptual development. The content of the work is sufficiently developed, but it lacks thoughtful, original, and imaginative resolution and/or attention to detail and craft. The work employs process, but does not demonstrate notable solutions.

###### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
The performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. The work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s). The impact of the work is weak with unsound, unoriginal, or unimaginative thinking. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and/or poor craft.

###### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
The performance & attendance of the student has not met course requirements. The work shows no overall understanding of the research, design, and/or prototyping phase(s) on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.


### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, myspace, etc. When your classmates are presenting, please close your laptops.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.
