## PERSONAL KANBAN
**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks** using <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.).
<ul>
<li>I recommend using post-its so you can move them around
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban (but you are not limited to) are:
* To-Do
* Today
* Next Week
* Done

If you use Kanbanery.com, please go to **Settings**, and under **General Settings** **enable** a *public URL* and make sure you press **Update** at the bottom of the General Settings page. Then, copy and paste your public URL to basecamp as a comment to the specific kanbanery.com message.


## PROCESS WEBSITE

You should have a **dedicated**, process website to document the **weekly** or **daily** progress of your Senior Project in wordpress on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu
* Students are expected to share their progress with the instructor and class using
their Project Website.
* You can receive web server space from IDM’s Technology Manager, Elton Kwok, MAGNET 883. Email eltonkwok@nyu.edu to set up an appointment for your web server space
* IDM’s FTP server info: http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu (Use active mode to connect)
* Create a *thesis* folder (or another folder name of your choice)
* Install wordpress in this folder
* Make and appointment with Elton to connect a database to this particular wordpress installation

Spencer Hargiss’ project website is a good example, http://www.spencerhargiss.com/thesis/. Please use Spencer’s project website as a guide. Why?  
* You can clearly read what his project was about due to his about link. You don’t have to wade through to the beginning of his posts to find this out. His navigation stands out due to its visual hierarchy.
* He explicitly stated what he did, concisely and clearly.
* He had visual documentation (images and screenshots). 
* However, most importantly, he had supporting text for these images and screenshots.

## What your process website should contain?

**What have you done this past week for your project?**
(which should be your done column essentially from your personal kanban)
* *Weekly Project Progress* 
 * at least, 1 post per week DUE 10am on Wednesdays. 
* (or even better) *Daily Project Progress* at least, 1 post per day for at least 4 or 5 days of the week.

  * The majority of the posts should be your own writing (well-composed and proofread for impeccable spelling and grammar).
  * brainstorming process for project idea
  * pdfs of any presentations (annotated)
  * Milestones / Tasks that have been completed (reference Personal Kanban entries from above)
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include images, illustrations, audio, video, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your project. 
  * If you do not do anything for the week, write **I did not work on this project this week.**

* *Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration* 
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences is more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your project. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.)


**What your project website should NOT contain?**
* How you are feeling about your process or project? This is different than evaluating or reflecting about what is working and what is not working. In other words, don’t rant, complain, blame, self-deprecate or make excuses on your project website. 
* This is a public representation of you as an artist, designer, creative technologist and/or entrepreneur. You want it to be as professional as possible. You want prospective employers, gallery owners, venture capitalists, and/or possible collaborators to take you seriously.
* Any content that is NOT related to your project explicitly.
